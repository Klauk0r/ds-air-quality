    "# DNN Assignment\n",
    "In this assignment you are working together with your teammates from the second project. You will apply your new knowledge about dense neural networks to the data from your ML project to investigate, if you can make further improvements on prediction performance. Your data is (hopefully) already cleaned and transformed (this was part of your ML project) such that you can focus fully on feeding it to your neural network. Use TensorFlow 2.x in this assignment as it makes training with real-life data much more easier with many implemented features (e.g. early-stopping, tensorboard, regularization, etc.). \n",

    "## Model tuning\n",
    "You might have no luck with your first model (most surely you did not). In this section you will apply methods you know to tune your model's performance. An obvious way of course is to change your model's architecture (removing or adding layers or layer dimensions, changing activation functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, after this you might still be able to detect some overfitting and there are some more methods you can apply to improve your neural network. Some of them are regularization, learning rate decay, early stopping, or dropout. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add regularization you can apply directly layer-wise L2- or L1-regularization by using a layer's `kernel_regularization` argument and an appropriate regularizer from the [`tensorflow.keras.regularizers`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/regularizers) module we imported for you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Optimizer schedules__<br>\n",
    "Quite often your optimizer does not run efficiently through the loss function surface. Remember that theory ensures a convergence of mini-batch SGD if and only if the learing rate decreases sufficiently fast. A way to apply this to your model training is to use a learning rate scheduler (learning rate decay) that reduces the learning rate over the number of update steps. The [`tf.keras.optimizers.schedules`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/schedules) module offers you some approaches to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to apply this to your `model_compile_and_fit()` function you defined above you need to implement the learning rate schedule either in there or with a helper function that your function calls inside. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to visualize different schedulers you can define them and call them on a range of values and plot them in a line plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Early stopping__<br>\n",
    "Earyl stopping is a procedure that enables you to stop your training earlier than defined by your `max_epochs` argument. It is used in practices to \n",
    "1. determine the optimal parameter vector by monitoring the validation error closely (if it rises again too much stuck with the best parameters found until then) and\n",
    "2. to save expensive resources (either in terms of monetary costs or ecological costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement early stopping in TensorFlow the `tf.keras` module offers you a `callback` named [`tf.keras.callback.EarlyStopping()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping) that monitors for you a certain metric (it makes sense here to use a validation metric) and to stop training after a certain number of epochs with no improvement or by defining a certain `min_delta` that defines a minimum value of improvement - if below the callback stops your training. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can add this callback simply to the callbacks defined in your `get_callbacks()` function you defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dropout__<br>\n",
    "Dropout was one of the important developments in regularization for neural networks. It was developed by Geoffrey Hinton and his team at Toronto University. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout can be applied to each layer in your network and is implemented in `tf.keras` by an own layer named `Dropout()` awaiting a dropout rate set by you. So to introduce dropout you have to rework your model design.  \n",

However, any model is callable like a `layer` by invoking it on either an `Input` or on the output of another layer. Furthermore, you can also stack outputs together.\n",

    "To produce an ensemble you can define a couple of models, than use their predictions as inputs for another model and produce a final output (using `keras.Model(input, output)`). But you can also start simple and use the mean predictions over all models and then compute the `argmax()` to assign them to a class in classification (via using `layers.average([model1_preds,model2_preds,...])`). You will be surprised how well this works. \n",
